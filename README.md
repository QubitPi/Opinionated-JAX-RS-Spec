# JAX-RS Specification

**Opinionated** [JAX-RS spec](https://github.com/jax-rs/spec) for Webservice developers, i.e. those info directly related to implementing API are removed so that Webservice developers only get to focus on using API and, thus, can read through it much quicker.

In addition, the following opinionated modifications are made:

* Simplify LaTeX source code. The [original](https://github.com/jax-rs/spec) is the most extraordinarily horrible LaTeX project I've seen in terms of code
  maintainability
* Remove useless information, such as 
  - "`http://example.org/...` represent URIs." (Who doesn't know???)
  - Texts like "for more info, see (some link)". Reading an API should not be DFS
  - Bibliography. I haven't even looked at a bibliography in my life yet
  - (much more...)

This fork, suitable for Webservice developers, gives you the same official spec that requires much less time to read.
