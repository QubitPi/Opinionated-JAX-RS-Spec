# JAX-RS Specification

Opinionated spec for Webservice developers, i.e. those directly related to API implementors are removed so Webservice 
developer can read through it much quicker.

In addition, the following opinionated modifications are made:

* Simplify LaTeX source code. The original is the most extraordinarily horrible LaTeX project I've seen in terms of code
  maintainability
* Remove useless information, such as 
  - "`http://example.org/...` represent URIs." (Who doesn't know???)
  - Texts like "for more info, see <some link>". Reading an API should not be DFS
  - Bibliography. I haven't even looked at a bibliography in my life yet

This fork, suitable for Webservice developers, gives you the same official spec that requires much less time to read.
