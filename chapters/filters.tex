\chapter{Filters and Interceptors}
\label{filters_and_interceptors}

Filters and entity interceptors can be registered for execution at well-defined extension points in JAX-RS
implementations. \textcolor{highlight green}{They are used to extend an implementation in order to provide capabilities
such as logging, confidentiality, authentication, entity compression, etc.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction_filters}

Entity interceptors wrap around a method invocation at a specific extension point. Filters execute code at an extension
point but without wrapping a method invocation. There are four extension points for filters: ClientRequest,
ClientResponse, ContainerRequest and ContainerResponse. There are two extension points for entity interceptors:
ReadFrom and WriteTo. For each of these extension points, there is a corresponding interface:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    public interface ClientRequestFilter {

    void filter(ClientRequestContext requestContext) throws IOException;
    }

    public interface ClientResponseFilter {

    void filter(ClientRequestContext requestContext,
    ClientResponseContext responseContext) throws IOException;
    }

    public interface ContainerRequestFilter {

    void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext) throws IOException;
    }

    public interface ContainerResponseFilter {

    void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext,
    ContainerResponseContext responseContext) throws IOException;
    }
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    public interface ReaderInterceptor {

    Object aroundReadFrom(ReaderInterceptorContext context)
    throws java.io.IOException, javax.ws.rs.WebApplicationException;
    }

    public interface WriterInterceptor {

    void aroundWriteTo(WriterInterceptorContext context)
    throws java.io.IOException, javax.ws.rs.WebApplicationException;
    }
\end{lstlisting}

A client filter is a class that implements ClientRequestFilter or ClientResponseFilter, or both.
\textcolor{highlight green}{A container filter is a class that implements ContainerRequestFilter or
ContainerResponseFilter, or both}. An entity interceptor is a class that implements ReaderInterceptor or
WriterInterceptor, or both. Filters and entity interceptors are providers and, as such, may be annotated with @Provider
for automatic discovery.

In the Client API, a ClientRequestFilter is executed as part of the invocation pipeline, before the HTTP request is
delivered to the network; a ClientResponseFilter is executed upon receiving a server response, before control is
returned to the application.

In the Server API, a ContainerRequestFilter is executed upon receiving a request from a client; a
ContainerResponseFilter is executed as part of the response pipeline, before the HTTP response is delivered to the
network.

A globally-bound (see Section \ref{global_binding}) ContainerRequestFilter is a container filter executed after resource
matching unless it is annotated with \lstinline{@PreMatching}. The use of this annotation on this type of filters
defines a new extension point for applications to use, namely PreMatchContainerRequest. Certain ContainerRequestContext
methods may not be available at this extension point.

An entity interceptor implementing ReaderInterceptor wraps around calls to \lstinline{MessageBodyReader}'s method
\lstinline{readFrom}. An entity interceptor implementing WriterInterceptor wraps around calls to
\lstinline{MessageBodyWriter}'s method \lstinline{writeTo}. JAX-RS implementations are REQUIRED to call registered
interceptors when mapping representations to Java types and vice versa. See Section \ref{entity_providers} for more
information on entity providers.

Please refer to Appendix \ref{processing_pipeline} for some diagrams on the client and server processing pipelines that
show the interaction between filters and entity interceptors.

\section{Filters}
\label{filters}

Filters are grouped into filter chains. There is a separate filter chain for each extension point introduced in the
previous section, namely: ClientRequest, ClientResponse, ContainerRequest, ContainerResponse and
PreMatchContainerRequest. \textcolor{highlight green}{Filters in a chain are sorted based on their priorities} (see
Section \ref{priorities}) and are executed in order.

The following example shows an implementation of a container logging filter: each method simply logs the message and
returns.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    @Provider
    class LoggingFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter, ContainerResponseFilter {

    @Override
    public void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext)
    throws IOException {
    log(requestContext);
    }

    @Override
    public void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext,
    ContainerResponseContext responseContext) throws IOException {
    log(responseContext);
    }

    ...
    }
\end{lstlisting}

ContainerRequestContext is a mutable class that provides request-specific information for the filter, such as the
request URI, message headers, message entity or request-scoped properties. The exposed setters allow (certain)
modification of the request before it is processed by the resource method. Similarly, there is a corresponding
ContainerResponseContext that provides response-specific information.

Request filters implementing ClientRequestFilter or ContainerRequestFilter can stop the execution of their corresponding
chains by calling \lstinline{abortWith(Response)} in their corresponding context object. If this method is invoked,
JAX-RS implementations are REQUIRED to abort execution of the chain and treat the response object as if produced by
calling the resource method (Server API) or executing the HTTP invocation (Client API). For example, upon a cache hit,
a client caching filter may call \lstinline{abortWith(Response)} to abort execution and optimize network access.

As stated above, a ContainerRequestFilter that is annotated with \lstinline{@PreMatching} is executed upon receiving a
client request but before a resource method is matched. Thus, this type of filter has the ability to modify the input to
the matching algorithm and, consequently, alter its outcome. The following example uses a ContainerRequestFilter
annotated with \lstinline{@PreMatching} to tunnel requests via POST by using the X-HTTP-Method-Override header to
overwrite the HTTP method prior to resource matching.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    @Provider
    @PreMatching
    public class HttpMethodOverrideFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter {

    @Override
    public void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext)
    throws IOException {
    if (requestContext.getMethod().equalsIgnoreCase("POST")) {
    String override = requestContext.getHeaders()
    .getFirst("X-HTTP-Method-Override");
    if (override != null) {
    requestContext.setMethod(override);
    }
    }
    }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Entity Interceptors}
\label{entity_interceptors}

An entity interceptor implements interface ReaderInterceptor or WriterInterceptor, or both. There is an interceptor
chain for each kind of entity interceptor. Entity interceptors in a chain are sorted based on their priorities
(see Section \ref{priorities}) and are executed in order.

As part of the JAX-RS processing pipeline (see Appendix \ref{processing_pipeline}), entity interceptors wrap calls to
the methods \lstinline{readFrom} in classes implementing \lstinline{MessageBodyReader} and \lstinline{writeTo} in
classes implementing \lstinline{MessageBodyWriter}. An interceptor SHOULD explicitly call the context method
\lstinline{proceed} to continue the execution of the chain. Because of their wrapping nature, failure to call this
method will prevent execution of the wrapped method in the corresponding message body reader or message body writer.

The following example shows an implementation of a GZIP entity interceptor that provides deflate and inflate
capabilities~\footnote{This class is not intended to be a complete implementation of this interceptor.}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    @Provider
    class GzipInterceptor implements ReaderInterceptor, WriterInterceptor {

    @Override
    Object aroundReadFrom(ReaderInterceptorContext ctx) ... {
    if (isGzipped(ctx)) {
    InputStream old = ctx.getInputStream();
    ctx.setInputStream(new GZIPInputStream(old));
    try {
    return ctx.proceed();
    } finally {
    ctx.setInputStream(old);
    }
    } else {
    return ctx.proceed();
    }
    }

    @Override
    void aroundWriteTo(WriterInterceptorContext ctx) ... {
    OutputStream old = ctx.getOutputStream();
    GZIPOutputStream gzipOutputStream = new GZIPOutputStream(old);
    ctx.setOutputStream(gzipOutputStream);
    updateHeaders(ctx);
    try {
    ctx.proceed();
    } finally {
    gzipOutputStream.finish();
    ctx.setOutputStream(old);
    }
    }
    ...
    }
\end{lstlisting}

The context types, ReaderInterceptorContext and WriterInterceptorContext, provide read and write access to the
parameters of the corresponding wrapped methods. In the example shown above, the input and output streams are wrapped
and updated in the context object before proceeding. JAX-RS implementations MUST use the last parameter values set in
the context object when calling the wrapped methods \lstinline{MessageBodyReader.readFrom} and
\lstinline{MessageBodyWriter.writeTo}.

It is worth noting that a \lstinline{readFrom} or a \lstinline{writeTo} that is called directly from application code,
e.g.~via the injection of a \lstinline{Providers} instance, will not trigger the execution of any entity interceptors
since it is not part of the normal JAX-RS processing pipeline.

\section{Lifecycle}

By default, just like all the other providers, \textcolor{highlight green}{a single instance of each filter or entity
interceptor is instantiated for each JAX-RS application}. First the constructor is called, then any requested
dependencies are injected, then the appropriate methods are called (simultaneously) as needed. Implementations MAY offer
alternative lifecycle options beyond the default one. See Section \ref{lifecycle_and_environment} for additional
information.

\section{Binding}

Binding is the process by which a filter or interceptor is associated with a resource class or method (Server API) or an
invocation (Client API). The forms of binding presented in the next sections are only supported as part of the Server
API. See Section \ref{binding_in_client_api} for binding in the Client API.

\subsection{Global Binding}
\label{global_binding}

Global binding is the default type of binding. A filter or interceptor that has no annotations is assumed to be bound
globally, i.e.~it applies to all the resource methods in an application. Like any other provider, a filter or
interceptor can be registered manually (e.g., via \lstinline{Application} or \lstinline{Configuration}) or be discovered
automatically. Note that \textcolor{highlight green}{for a filter or interceptor to be automatically discovered it MUST
be annotated with @Provider} (see Section \ref{automatic_discovery}).

For example, the \lstinline{LoggingFilter} defined in Section \ref{filters} is both automatically discovered (it is
annotated with @Provider) and bound globally. If this filter is part of an application, requests and responses will be
logged for all resource methods.

As stated in Section \ref{introduction_filters}, a global ContainerRequestFilter is executed after resource matching
unless annotated with \lstinline{@PreMatching}. A global filter that injects \lstinline{ResourceInfo}, and generally
depends on resource information for its execution, must not be annotated with \lstinline{@PreMatching}.

\subsection{Name Binding}
\label{Name_Binding}

A filter or interceptor can be associated with a resource class or method by declaring a new binding annotation. These
annotations are declared using the JAX-RS meta-annotation \lstinline{@NameBinding} and are used to decorate both the
filter (or interceptor) and the resource method or resource class. For example, the \lstinline{LoggingFilter} defined in
Section \ref{filters} can be bound to the method \lstinline{hello} in \lstinline{MyResourceClass}, instead of globally,
as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    @Provider
    @Logged
    class LoggingFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter, ContainerResponseFilter {

    ...
    }
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    @Path("/")
    public class MyResourceClass {

    @GET
    @Logged
    @Path("{name}")
    @Produces("text/plain")
    public String hello(@PathParam("name") String name) {
    return "Hello " + name;
    }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

According to the semantics of \lstinline{LoggingFilter}, the request will be logged before the \lstinline{hello} method
is called and the response will be logged after it returns. The declaration of the \lstinline{@Logged} annotation is
shown next.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    @NameBinding
    @Target({ ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD })
    @Retention(value = RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
    public @interface Logged { }
\end{lstlisting}

Multiple filters and interceptors can be bound to a single resource method using additional annotations. For example,
given the following filter:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    @Provider
    @Authenticated
    class AuthenticationFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter {

    ...
    }
\end{lstlisting}

method \lstinline{hello} above could be decorated with \lstinline{@Logged} and \lstinline{@Authenticated} in order to
provide both logging and authentication capabilities to the resource.

A filter or interceptor class can be decorated with multiple binding annotations. In this case, all those annotations
must be present in the resource class or method for the binding to be established. For example, if
\lstinline{LoggingFilter} is defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    @Logged
    @Verbose
    @Provider
    class LoggingFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter, ContainerResponseFilter {

    ...
    }
\end{lstlisting}

then method \lstinline{hello} above must be annotated with both \lstinline{@Logged} and \lstinline{@Verbose} for the
binding to be in effect.

Binding annotations can also be applied to resource classes and \lstinline{Application} subclasses. Binding annotations
that decorate resource classes apply to all resource methods defined in them. Binding annotations that decorate
\lstinline{Application} subclasses can also be used to bind filters and interceptors globally, even if other annotations
are present. For example, \lstinline{LoggingFilter} as defined at the beginning of this section can be bound globally as
follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    @Logged
    public class MyApplication extends Application {

    ...
    }
\end{lstlisting}

Note that returning filters or interceptors from the methods \lstinline{getClasses} or \lstinline{getSingletons} in an
application subclass will bind them globally only if they are not decorated with a name binding annotation. If they are
decorated with at least one name binding annotation, the application subclass must be annotated as shown above in order
for those filters or interceptors to be bound globally. See Chapter \ref{applications} for more information on JAX-RS
applications.

\subsection{Dynamic Binding}
\label{dynamic_binding}

The annotation-based forms of binding presented thus far are static. Dynamic binding is also supported using dynamic
features. A dynamic feature is a provider that implements the DynamicFeature interface. These providers are used to
augment the set of filters and entity interceptors bound to a resource method.

The following example defines a dynamic feature that binds the filter \lstinline{LoggingFilter} -- assumed not globally
bound for the purpose of this example -- with all the resource methods in \lstinline{MyResource} that are annotated with
\lstinline{@GET}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    @Provider
    public final class DynamicLoggingFilterFeature implements DynamicFeature {

    @Override
    public void configure(ResourceInfo resourceInfo, FeatureContext context) {
    if (MyResource.class.isAssignableFrom(resourceInfo.getResourceClass())
    && resourceInfo.getResourceMethod().isAnnotationPresent(GET.class)) {
    context.register(new LoggingFilter());
    }
    }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

The overridden method in this provider updates the \lstinline{Configuration} object assigned to each resource method;
the information about the resource method is provided in the form of a \lstinline{ResourceInfo} instance.
JAX-RS implementations SHOULD resolve dynamic features for filters and interceptors once for each resource method. It is
RECOMMENDED to process dynamic features at application deployment time.

\subsection{Binding in Client API}
\label{binding_in_client_api}

Binding in the Client API is accomplished via API calls instead of annotations. Client, Invocation, InvocationBuilder
and WebTarget are all configurable types: their configuration can be accessed using the methods inherited from the
\lstinline{Configurable} interface. See Section \ref{configurable_types} for more information.

\section{Priorities}
\label{priorities}

The order in which filters and interceptors are executed as part of their corresponding chains is controlled by the \lstinline{@Priority}\ annotation defined in \cite{jsr250}.
Priorities are represented by integer numbers. Execution chains for extension points ContainerRequest, PreMatchContainerRequest, ClientRequest, ReadFrom and WriteTo are sorted in \emph{ascending order}; the lower the number the higher the priority. Execution chains for extension points ContainerResponse and ClientResponse\ are sorted in \emph{descending order}; the higher the number the higher the priority. These rules ensure that response filters are executed in reversed order of request filters.

The \lstinline{Priorities} class in JAX-RS defines a set of built-in priorities for security, header decorators, decoders and encoders. The default binding priority is \lstinline{javax.ws.rs.Priorities.USER}. For example, the priority of an authentication filter can be set as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    @Provider
    @Authenticated
    @Priority(Priorities.AUTHENTICATION)
    public class AuthenticationFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter {
    ...
    }
\end{lstlisting}

Note that even though, as explained in Section \ref{binding_in_client_api}, annotations are not used for binding in the Client API, they are still used to define priorities. Therefore, if a priority other than the default is required, the \lstinline{@Priority}\ annotation must be used for a filter or interceptor registered with the Client API.

The order in which filters and interceptors that belong to the same priority class are executed is implementation dependent.

\section{Exceptions}
\label{exceptions_filters_and_interceptors}

\subsection{Server Runtime}

When a filter or interceptor method throws an exception, the server runtime will process the exception as described in
Section \ref{exceptions_providers_server}. As explained in Section \ref{exceptionmapper}, an application can supply
exception mapping providers. At most one exception mapper MUST be used in a single request processing cycle to avoid
potentially infinite loops.

A response mapped from an exception MUST be processed using the ContainerResponse filter chain and the WriteTo
interceptor chain (if an entity is present in the mapped response). The number of entries in these chains depends on
whether a resource method has been matched or not at the time the exception is thrown. There are two cases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If a web resource has been matched before the exception was thrown, then the filters in ContainerResponse and
    the interceptors in WriteTo will include everything that has been bound to the method as well as globally;
    \item\label{no_matching} Otherwise, only global filters and interceptors will be included.
\end{enumerate}

Note that a filter or interceptor invoked in case \ref{no_matching} will not have access to resource-dependent
information, such as that returned by an injectable instance of \lstinline{ResourceInfo}.

\subsection{Client Runtime}

When a filter or interceptor method throws an exception, the client runtime will process the exception as described in
Section \ref{exceptions_providers_client}.
